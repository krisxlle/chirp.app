# Chirp - Social Media Platform

## Overview

Chirp is a social media platform with dual implementations:
1. **Web Application**: React frontend with Express backend for full-featured desktop experience
2. **Mobile Application**: Expo/React Native application for mobile platforms

Both applications share the same backend services and database. The mobile app provides a native mobile experience with tab navigation and platform-specific UI components.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Interface preference: Original React web client from client/ directory, NOT Expo mobile app.

## System Architecture

The application follows a full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend:

### Frontend Architecture
**Web Application**:
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building

**Mobile Application (Expo)**:
- **Framework**: Expo/React Native with TypeScript
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with tab-based navigation
- **Components**: React Native components with custom UI elements
- **Styling**: React Native StyleSheet and themed components
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (iOS, Android, Web)

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Replit OAuth integration
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for content generation

## Key Components

### Database Schema

- **Chirps**: Contains user posts with content and metadata
- **Follows**: Manages user relationships (follower/following)
- **Reactions**: Stores emoji reactions to chirps
- **Notifications**: Handles user notifications for interactions
- **Sessions**: Manages user session data for authentication

### Authentication System
- Uses Replit's OAuth service for user authentication
- Session-based authentication with PostgreSQL storage
- Middleware protection for authenticated routes
- Automatic token refresh and session management

### API Structure
- RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- Protected routes requiring authentication
- Error handling with consistent response format
- Request logging and monitoring

### Frontend Components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with max-width container
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui for consistent UI components
- **State Management**: React Query for caching and synchronization
- **Navigation**: Bottom navigation for mobile experience

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: OAuth flow through Replit's service
2. **Data Fetching**: React Query manages API calls and caching
3. **Real-time Updates**: Polling for notifications and new content
4. **State Synchronization**: Query invalidation keeps data fresh
5. **Error Handling**: Centralized error management with toast notifications

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **Neon PostgreSQL**: Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database
- **Connection**: Via `@neondatabase/serverless` package
- **Migrations**: Drizzle migrations for schema changes

### AI Services
- **OpenAI API**: For generating user summaries and avatars
- **Content Generation**: Weekly summaries and profile images
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for AI service failures

## Recent Changes

**July 22, 2025 - Expo Application Debugging and Resolution**
- **Issue**: Expo/React Native application failed to start due to configuration conflicts and import path resolution errors
- **Root Cause**: Mixed TypeScript configurations between Expo and Node.js environments causing module resolution failures
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Fixed missing 'dev' script in package.json to properly start Expo web server on port 5000
  - Systematically replaced all `@/` import aliases with relative paths throughout the Expo application
  - Added explicit React imports to resolve UMD global errors in all components and pages
  - Fixed image asset imports to use correct relative paths
  - Updated import paths in components, hooks, and app directories for proper module resolution
- **Result**: Application successfully loads with Metro bundler serving 967 modules, accessible via web and mobile platforms
- **Technical Notes**: 
  - Expo's module resolution differs from standard Node.js/Vite setups
  - Relative paths are more reliable than aliases in Expo projects
  - All components now properly import React to avoid UMD global issues

## Project Status
- **Web Application**: Fully functional with complete social media features
- **Mobile Application**: Successfully restored and running via Expo
- **Backend Services**: Operational with PostgreSQL database and Express API
- **Development Environment**: Both applications can run simultaneously for cross-platform development

### Authentication
- **Replit OAuth**: Integrated authentication service
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed session management
- **OIDC**: OpenID Connect for secure authentication

### UI Components
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Lucide Icons**: Consistent icon library

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Environment**: Replit development environment
- **Hot Reload**: Vite HMR for fast development
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL development instance

### Production
- **Build Process**: Expo export builds web assets for deployment
- **Build Script**: `npm run build` exports Expo web app to dist directory
- **Static Assets**: Served from dist directory with proper index.html structure
- **Deployment**: Uses build script for Cloud Run deployment with autoscale
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.

### Configuration
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking enabled
- **ESM**: Full ES module support throughout
- **Path Aliases**: Simplified imports with @ prefixes

The application is designed to be scalable and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns and modern development practices. The mobile-first approach ensures good user experience across devices, while the AI features add engaging content generation capabilities.
