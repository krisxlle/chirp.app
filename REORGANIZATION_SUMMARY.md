# ✅ Project Reorganization Complete!

## 📁 New Structure Overview

The project has been reorganized to clearly separate Metro (React Native/Expo) and Web code:

### 🏗️ Root Structure
```
chirp.app/
├── metro/              # 📱 Metro/React Native code
├── web/                # 🌐 Web-specific code
├── shared/             # 🔄 Shared code
├── server/             # 🖥️ Backend server
├── database/           # 🗄️ Database schemas
├── docs/               # 📚 Documentation
└── config/             # ⚙️ Configuration files
```

### 📱 Metro Directory (`metro/`)
Contains all React Native/Expo specific code:
- `components/` - Metro components (ChirpCard, ComposeChirp, etc.)
- `hooks/` - Metro-specific hooks
- `lib/` - Metro utilities and database connections
- `assets/` - Metro assets (fonts, images)
- `constants/` - Metro constants (Colors, etc.)
- `android/` - Android platform code
- `ios/` - iOS platform code
- `metro.config.js` - Metro bundler config
- `app.json` - Expo app configuration
- `eas.json` - EAS build configuration
- `capacitor.config.ts` - Capacitor configuration

### 🌐 Web Directory (`web/`)
Contains all web-specific code:
- `client/` - Web client application
  - `src/components/` - Web components
  - `src/pages/` - Web pages
  - `src/hooks/` - Web-specific hooks
  - `src/lib/` - Web utilities
  - `public/` - Web public assets
  - `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration
- `api/` - Vercel serverless functions
  - `chirps.js` - Chirps API
  - `chirps/thread.js` - Thread API
  - `notifications/unread-count.js` - Notifications API
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind CSS config

### 🔄 Shared Directory (`shared/`)
Contains code used by both Metro and Web:
- `schema.ts` - Shared TypeScript types
- `utils/` - Shared utilities

## 🚀 Development Commands

### Metro Development
```bash
# Start Metro development server
npm run start

# Build Metro app
npm run build
```

### Web Development
```bash
# Start web development server
npm run dev

# Build web app
npm run build:web
```

## 📦 Benefits of New Structure

1. **Clear Separation**: Easy to distinguish Metro vs Web code
2. **Independent Development**: Work on Metro and Web separately
3. **Shared Code**: Common utilities and types in shared folder
4. **Better Organization**: Related files grouped together
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Clear boundaries between platforms

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. Update import paths in both Metro and Web code
2. Update build scripts to use new structure
3. Update documentation
4. Test both Metro and Web builds

The reorganization makes it much easier to:
- Understand which code belongs to which platform
- Maintain and update platform-specific features
- Share common code between platforms
- Deploy and build each platform independently
